### Objective

The main goal of this project is to explore and learn to connect self-made api in rails with a react app, integrating modern technologies (EcmaScript, webpack, npm, context api, hooks etc...) for extending the capabilities of the tools (rails and react) while consuming third party API's.

In this game you could find:

- A stack to create categories of sport routines
- A system to authenticate users from my rails api
- fetching imgs associated with titles
- A clock to manage time
- a tasks subcategory for managing properly routines
- Nice ui

The following features are under construction:

- chat
- adding friend system
- sharing routines among poeple
